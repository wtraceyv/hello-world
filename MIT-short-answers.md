# MIT Questions?
Hello, there.
I hope it's clear what I'm doing here. Let's find a preview shall we?

Ah, there we are. **(Control+Shift+M)**

How's about some Python, just for kicks:
   ```
# huehuehue
def my_message():
   message = "Hello Markdown!"
   print message
my_message()

output: Hello Markdown!

# p.s. ... setup your damn GitHub, Walter. Organize that shit.
# Sincerely, Walter of The Past
   ```
Well, now that we know *that* works...

Why don't I just set this up like an article of sorts? The longer I type, the less this feels like the gung-ho, Sublime Text-enabled, fear-fueled, extended college application essay of two months ago, the more it feels like a whole different thing. Almost like embarking on on a new life, which is perhaps more fitting (oh, I'm getting hopeful now!).

Here, I suppose I'll document the questions I hopefully answer well on the MIT application, which only consists of ~5 short answer questions, the longest of which only allow 250 words maximum...as if I already didn't want to choose my words carefully.

Nonetheless, the environment of a code editor, seemingly unbridled and prepared for the spattering of code which may or may not completely make sense by the end, is well-suited to the feelings I'm having regarding the task at hand -- why wouldn't I use it? It's even open source, after all.

# Yes, MIT Questions, Walter
Just a reminder to myself: be simple. Read a lot of blogs. Keep doing this journaling thing, because in the end, I'm sure it will serve us well. OH, use **metaphors**! Sometimes. They're enticing, descriptive, and ultimately make more sense of the slop you may accidentally spill all over your screen (see what I did there?). They might be the tempered glass that protects the screen which brightly displays your hopes, wit, and honesty from the cold ground the admissions officers build (and they're at MIT, man; they know how to build a simple floor--it's surely got heat-seeking missiles and such, too). Not that the admissions officers don't sound like the most kind, accepting people I'll ever meet, but an 8% acceptance rate implies quite a high standard. I just hope I'm reasonably one of the 8%.

# For The Pleasure of It - The First Hurdle

**We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do for the pleasure of it. (100 words max)**

As an energetic five year-old, running in circles, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and indulging in Spider-Man media were not always sufficient pastimes for me. I can't express how thankful I am that my father had beaten Charvel guitars lying around from his high school days. Any guitar and any form of drums from then on have become my outlets and teachers of excited research, self-teaching, and the substance of passion; still today, the ongoing legacy of Metallica and countless other musical artists mold my personality into the emotional, honest, and technical entity that it has become.  

# Cool departments, yeah...

**Although you may not yet know what you want to major in, which department or program at MIT appeals to you and why? (100 words)**

Battlecode, Tetris on the green building, drones?! A living history of pushing computers to their limits?!! The computer science department at MIT in short just sounds like the perfect implementation of fun with work. Even while I'm working on course work for a programming class, I can get caught up in the revolutionary and fun ways people have used computers, especially at MIT; who wouldn't love to be a part of that? I want to be somewhere that inspires to delve deeper into my work just as a byproduct.

# Being helpful! Woo!

**At MIT, we bring people together to better the lives of others. MIT students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world's biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way in which you have contributed to your community, whether in your family, the classroom, your neighborhood, etc. (*) (200-250 words)**

It's like your own personal, self-fulfilled, instant fireworks show on the Fourth of July; like painting a dissected Aurora Borealis into someone else's mind, allowing him/her to finish the puzzle; like finishing a musical duet with a partner who began a little late, but together you conquer by supporting the late-comer. How is being a tutor not the first thing to come to mind?! I get to illuminate the wonders of vector addition and force diagrams, factoring and distributing, derivatives and antiderivatives to students in need for an hour, fueled by the fulfillment of feelings like those above -- I would gladly work only for them.

Aside from improving the community's academic performance (which any district could use), I'm convinced my work serves a more existential purpose: illuminating the art of asking questions early on in life. Not just asking in the first place, but asking critically, starting zoomed out if starting zoomed too far into the problem isn't advantageous, and tackling problems from the outside inward, maintaining understanding all the while. Please, ask me again why calculus matters and sounds simple but doesn't evaluate easily (it's the algebra IN the calculus!), or why English (communication) matters, or why history matters. I'll gladly paint the northern lights in anyone's mind who proudly asks, and if not, I'll show you how to ask. No one is born with all the answers; in fact, the answers aren't really what spurs us on -- it's if and how you ask the questions.

# Background huehue
**Describe the world you come from; for example, your family, clubs, school, community, city, or town. How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations?(*) (200-250 words)**

Between environment and family situation, it's hard to choose one thing that has proved most influential on my aspirations. Both have introduced their own circumstances which added both adversity and uniqueness to my situation, ultimately (I think) adding to my maturity and capacity to fulfill my own dreams.

My family situation has been...dynamic. My parents divorced when I was two, and at that same age I met my wonderful step dad, Nathan. My mom came to date, move in with, marry, and have three children with Nathan, two of which would be on the autistic spectrum; this would've been a lot more difficult if we hadn't a fantastic joint learning relationship (and his southern charm). Seeing my dad only on weekends for fourteen years, helping raise those children in the chaos, and working and learning together with Nathan (as his "first" child) took enormous time sacrifices, but rendered me extremely mature, aware of the importance of maintaining these core relationships.

Ultimately my family circumstances combined with my environment (primarily rural, static, possibly unambitious Indiana) had always painted a certain mood lacking in the areas of "possibility" and "imagination", sometimes begging "resignation". I luckily saw these as beggars of creativity and aspiration rather than infinite barriers.

I've forged unforetold, everlasting relationships, taken chances, and baffled peers, not in pursuit of any special dreams (which may change daily), but of the drive to pursue them; my experience has taught me not to dream, but how and why to dream.

# Challenge...eeeee
**Tell us about the most significant challenge you've faced or something important that didn't go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? (200-250 words)**

My dad is not the healthiest (he's always smoked and been terribly overweight). I think it's fair that any well-meaning child wishes good health on his/her parents for obvious reasons, and I am no exception.

From the time when I understood the repercussions of my dad's diet and habit choices, I encouraged him in the direction I thought best for him. For my seventh birthday, I asked him to stop smoking. He did stop ten years later after a cold which made it painful to smoke anyway, but that's besides the point. Later on, his immune system was so weakened that a minor leg injury by the skirts of a boat landed him in the hospital for a few months and in my custodial household for several, during which we tried to coach him on a diet devoid of so much fast food and sugar (I excitedly brought him our tailored dishes). Soon, he will need hip surgery because of his weight distribution, and I fully support his moving forward somehow.

Silent encouragement, honest handwritten letters of encouragement, and hope proved the best solutions to problems like these. Learning that I couldn't save my dad from himself was one of my hardest lessons, but every day it illuminates the boundaries of worth to me, and I feel like few people I meet have defined that for themselves yet.

**(Optional) No admission application can meet the needs of every individual. If you think additional information or material will give us a more thorough impression of you, please respond below.**

There is one huge misconception that I would feel ridiculous not to catch, since I've been given this chance.

Along the course of reading my responses and even just getting to know me, I think my *emotion* and extreme care for honesty can come across as...not excited. Let me explain.

It would be a gross generalization to say that there are only two types of dads, but for our purposes let's just say there are: there is the maybe-overly-chill dad, and the understandably-, not-unreasonably-worried dad. Sure, everyone likes Chill Dad when they're young, because Chill Dad let's everything slide and doesn't worry anyone else. But later on, Chill Dad has a hard time making it obvious what it is he *does* care about. Worried Dad is confusing at first, but as time goes on, you understand: Worried Dad worries, not to be annoying, but because he cares about getting the important points across.

I like to think of myself an easygoing Worried Dad, only because I care a lot more about telling others how I deeply feel when it matters than keeping things safely light -- maybe a downside, but unchangeable and honestly something of which I am terribly proud.

Thank you for considering me (and all the encouragement through all your blogs)!
