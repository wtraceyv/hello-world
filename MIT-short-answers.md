# MIT Questions? - NO

Hello, there.
I hope it's clear what I'm doing here. Let's find a preview shall we?

Ah, there we are. **(Control+Shift+M)**

How's about some Python, just for kicks:
   ```
# huehuehue
def my_message():
   message = "Hello Markdown!"
   print message
my_message()

output: Hello Markdown!

# p.s. ... setup your damn GitHub, Walter. Organize that shit.
# Sincerely, Walter of The Past
   ```
Well, now that we know *that* works...

Why don't I just set this up like an article of sorts? The longer I type, the less this feels like the gung-ho, Sublime Text-enabled, fear-fueled, extended college application essay of two months ago, the more it feels like a whole different thing. Almost like embarking on on a new life, which is perhaps more fitting (oh, I'm getting hopeful now!).

Here, I suppose I'll document the questions I hopefully answer well on the MIT application, which only consists of ~5 short answer questions, the longest of which only allow 250 words maximum...as if I already didn't want to choose my words carefully.

Nonetheless, the environment of a code editor, seemingly unbridled and prepared for the spattering of code which may or may not completely make sense by the end, is well-suited to the feelings I'm having regarding the task at hand -- why wouldn't I use it? It's even open source, after all.

# Yes, MIT Questions, Walter -- NO
Just a reminder to myself: be simple. Read a lot of blogs. Keep doing this journaling thing, because in the end, I'm sure it will serve us well. OH, use **metaphors**! Sometimes. They're enticing, descriptive, and ultimately make more sense of the slop you may accidentally spill all over your screen (see what I did there?). They might be the tempered glass that protects the screen which brightly displays your hopes, wit, and honesty from the cold ground the admissions officers build (and they're at MIT, man; they know how to build a simple floor--it's surely got heat-seeking missiles and such, too). Not that the admissions officers don't sound like the most kind, accepting people I'll ever meet, but an 8% acceptance rate implies quite a high standard. I just hope I'm reasonably one of the 8%.

# For The Pleasure of It - The First Hurdle

**We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do for the pleasure of it. (100 words max)**

As an energetic five year-old, running in circles, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and indulging in Spider-Man media were not always sufficient pastimes for me. I can't express how thankful I am that my father had beaten Charvel guitars lying around from his high school days. Any guitar and any form of drums from then on have become my outlets and teachers of excited research, self-teaching, and the substance of passion; still today, the ongoing legacy of Metallica and countless other musical artists mold my personality into the emotional, honest, and technical entity that it has become.  

# NO

**Although you may not yet know what you want to major in, which department or program at MIT appeals to you and why? (100 words)**

You know what, I'll come back to this...

# Being helpful! Woo!

**At MIT, we bring people together to better the lives of others. MIT students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world's biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way in which you have contributed to your community, whether in your family, the classroom, your neighborhood, etc. (*) (200-250 words)**

It's like your own personal, self-fulfilled, instant fireworks show on the Fourth of July; like painting a dissected Aurora Borealis into someone else's mind, allowing him/her to finish the puzzle; like finishing a musical duet with a partner who began a little late, but together you conquer by supporting the late-comer. How is being a tutor not the first thing to come to mind?! I get to illuminate the wonders of vector addition and force diagrams, factoring and distributing, derivatives and antiderivatives to students in need for an hour, fueled by the fulfillment of feelings like those above -- I would gladly work only for them.

Aside from improving the community's academic performance (which any district could use), I'm convinced my work serves a more existential purpose: illuminating the art of asking questions early on in life. Not just asking in the first place, but asking critically, starting zoomed out if starting zoomed too far into the problem isn't advantageous, and tackling problems from the outside inward, maintaining understanding all the while. Please, ask me again why calculus matters and sounds simple but doesn't evaluate easily (it's the algebra IN the calculus!), or why English (communication) matters, or why history matters. I'll gladly paint the northern lights in anyone's mind who proudly asks, and if not, I'll show you how to ask. No one is born with all the answers; in fact, the answers aren't really what spurs us on -- it's if and how you ask the questions.

# NO
**Describe the world you come from; for example, your family, clubs, school, community, city, or town. How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations?(*) (200-250 words)**

Not yet, boi.

# NO
**Tell us about the most significant challenge you've faced or something important that didn't go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? (200-250 words)**

Ah I'm scared lol
