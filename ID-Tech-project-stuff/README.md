# ID Tech Project

Currently, files are not formatted quite how I would do it now. 
I don't really use JavaDoc, which is kind of dumb, and some of 
the design is just inefficient and/or nonintuitive, so changes 
perhaps to come for the sake of completeness and an example of 
learned skill. 

Characters.java was the archetype for the single "character", the player of the game. 

BlackJackMethod.java was written by Noah Migoski, and actually contained Black Jack, Slot Machine, and Rock Paper Scissors games to play in the "casino" module in my game. Uses money as needed.

AdventureWithRPS.java holds the main method, and was meant to be where the main story was executed and the other two files used (I *really* need to fix indents here, I know). 

At the moment, as mentioned, these are not works of art, nor necessarily works in progress. Just amusing stuff we did while learning some java; collaboration is a great thing.
